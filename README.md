- 👋 Hi, I’m @SoreScythe https://phcorner.net/members/sore-scythe.915755/
- 👀 I’m interested in PSP, Android, Emulation Software, and other sorts of software related development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and quite comfortable with python, also messed around with java(which I quite sadly now forgot even the basic syntax of)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, not really expecting anyone to be interested but I mess with crawlers and Terminal UI stuff on python while flailing around in the dark world of C.
- 📫 Reach me via gmail on sorescythe.dev
